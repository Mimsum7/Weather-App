# Weather-App

This is a mini project to help me learn how to use APIs using Open Weather API. It was originally a CLI project but I decided to create a front end with a simple user interface. In future, I may add more to the UI to beautify it a bit more but I am happy with the project's functionality as is.

HOW TO USE:
Download the 3 files and make sure Flask is installed on your machine.
If Flask is not installed, go to your command terminal and input: pip install flask requests
then run: python app.py
It will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser
You will be able to input a city name and it will display weather data
